Word Pattern
https://leetcode.com/problems/word-pattern/

Given a pattern and a string s, find if s follows the same pattern.

Here follow means a full match, such that there is a bijection between a letter in pattern and a non-empty word in s. Specifically:

  Each letter in pattern maps to exactly one unique word in s.
  Each unique word in s maps to exactly one letter in pattern.
  No two letters map to the same word, and no two words map to the same letter.

 
Example 1:

Input: pattern = "abba", s = "dog cat cat dog"

Output: true

Explanation:

The bijection can be established as:

  'a' maps to "dog".
  'b' maps to "cat".

Example 2:

Input: pattern = "abba", s = "dog cat cat fish"

Output: false

Example 3:

Input: pattern = "aaaa", s = "dog cat cat dog"

Output: false

 
Constraints:

  1 <= pattern.length <= 300
  pattern contains only lower-case English letters.
  1 <= s.length <= 3000
  s contains only lowercase English letters and spaces ' '.
  s does not contain any leading or trailing spaces.
  All the words in s are separated by a single space.
