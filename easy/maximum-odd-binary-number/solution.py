Maximum Odd Binary Number
https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-odd-binary-number/

You are given a binary string s that contains at least one '1'.

You have to rearrange the bits in such a way that the resulting binary number is the maximum odd binary number that can be created from this combination.

Return a string representing the maximum odd binary number that can be created from the given combination.

Note that the resulting string can have leading zeros.

 
Example 1:

Input: s = "010"
Output: "001"
Explanation: Because there is just one '1', it must be in the last position. So the answer is "001".

Example 2:

Input: s = "0101"
Output: "1001"
Explanation: One of the '1's must be in the last position. The maximum number that can be made with the remaining digits is "100". So the answer is "1001".

 
Constraints:

  1 <= s.length <= 100
  s consists only of '0' and '1'.
  s contains at least one '1'.
