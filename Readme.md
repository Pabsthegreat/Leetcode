# LeetCode Solutions Repository

This repository contains all the LeetCode problems I've solved and my understanding of them.

Why this exercise, you may ask? I found solving problems and then forgetting about them quite pointless; it felt like I was just chasing the number of questions solved. So, in an attempt to remember how each problem was solved and to help others, I have created this repository.

## Daily Practice Integration

This repository is integrated with [BetterLeetSync](https://github.com/Pabsthegreat/BetterLeetSync), which automatically sends daily emails featuring one of these LeetCode questions. This helps maintain consistent practice and reinforces problem-solving skills over time.

## Structure

The repository is divided into Easy, Medium, and Hard folders, with each problem organized in its own subdirectory containing solution files. Each file has the question at the top, with the topics listed below.
