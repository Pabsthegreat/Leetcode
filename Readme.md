This repository contains all the Leetcode problems I've solved and my understanding of them.
Why this exercise, you may ask? I found solving problems and then forgetting about them quite pointless; it felt like I was just chasing the number of questions solved. So, in an attempt to remember how each problem was solved and to help others, I have created this repository.

Structure
The Repo is divided into Easy, Medium and Hard folders and under each there is Python and C representing the language used to solve the question.
Each file has the question at the top, with the topics listed below.
