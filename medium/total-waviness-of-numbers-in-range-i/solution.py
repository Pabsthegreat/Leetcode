Total Waviness of Numbers in Range I
https://leetcode.com/problems/total-waviness-of-numbers-in-range-i/

You are given two integers num1 and num2 representing an inclusive range [num1, num2].

The waviness of a number is defined as the total count of its peaks and valleys:

  A digit is a peak if it is strictly greater than both of its immediate neighbors.
  A digit is a valley if it is strictly less than both of its immediate neighbors.
  The first and last digits of a number cannot be peaks or valleys.
  Any number with fewer than 3 digits has a waviness of 0.

Return the total sum of waviness for all numbers in the range [num1, num2].
 
Example 1:

Input: num1 = 120, num2 = 130

Output: 3

Explanation:
In the range [120, 130]:

  120: middle digit 2 is a peak, waviness = 1.
  121: middle digit 2 is a peak, waviness = 1.
  130: middle digit 3 is a peak, waviness = 1.
  All other numbers in the range have a waviness of 0.

Thus, total waviness is 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.

Example 2:

Input: num1 = 198, num2 = 202

Output: 3

Explanation:
In the range [198, 202]:

  198: middle digit 9 is a peak, waviness = 1.
  201: middle digit 0 is a valley, waviness = 1.
  202: middle digit 0 is a valley, waviness = 1.
  All other numbers in the range have a waviness of 0.

Thus, total waviness is 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.

Example 3:

Input: num1 = 4848, num2 = 4848

Output: 2

Explanation:

Number 4848: the second digit 8 is a peak, and the third digit 4 is a valley, giving a waviness of 2.

 
Constraints:

  1 <= num1 <= num2 <= 105
