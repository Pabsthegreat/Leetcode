Merge Intervals
https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-intervals/

Given an array of intervals where intervals[i] = [starti, endi], merge all overlapping intervals, and return an array of the non-overlapping intervals that cover all the intervals in the input.

 
Example 1:

Input: intervals = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Explanation: Since intervals [1,3] and [2,6] overlap, merge them into [1,6].

Example 2:

Input: intervals = [[1,4],[4,5]]
Output: [[1,5]]
Explanation: Intervals [1,4] and [4,5] are considered overlapping.

Example 3:

Input: intervals = [[4,7],[1,4]]
Output: [[1,7]]
Explanation: Intervals [1,4] and [4,7] are considered overlapping.

 
Constraints:

  1 <= intervals.length <= 104
  intervals[i].length == 2
  0 <= starti <= endi <= 104
